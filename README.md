### This is solution of ODE using the run-through method

**Notice:** you need *pentapy*, *numpy* and *matplotlib* python3 libraries to use this repo code. \
You can simply install them using ```python3 -m pip install <module>```.

To build, complete test solution and create plots just run

    ./test.bash

Plot will be avaliable in file *"./out/plot \<N\>.png"*.

You can just build binary solver with

    make

Syntax:

    ./main N

where N + 1 is amount of points in solution greed.
